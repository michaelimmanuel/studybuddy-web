# Dashboard Redesign - Bundle-Centric View

## Overview
The user dashboard has been completely redesigned to prioritize bundles and provide an intuitive way for users to access quizzes through their purchased bundles.

## Key Changes

### 1. **Bundle-First Design**
- **Collapsible Bundle Cards**: Each purchased bundle is displayed as an expandable card
- **Click to Expand**: Users can click on a bundle to reveal all packages inside
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Bundles are prominently displayed with gradient backgrounds

### 2. **Package Display Within Bundles**
- **Ordered List**: Packages are displayed in order (using the `order` field)
- **Numbered Badges**: Each package shows its position (1, 2, 3, etc.)
- **Package Details**: Shows title, description, question count, time limit, and price
- **Direct Quiz Access**: "Start Quiz →" button for each package navigates to `/quiz/[packageId]`

### 3. **Improved UI/UX**

#### Bundle Header Features:
- Bundle title and description
- Package count badge
- Total questions count
- Bundle price
- Savings calculation (shows amount and percentage saved)
- Expand/collapse arrow icon

#### Package Features:
- Position number in a blue circular badge
- Package title and description
- Metadata: question count, time limit, individual price
- "Start Quiz" button with hover effects
- Responsive layout (stacks on mobile)

### 4. **Individual Packages Section**
- Shows packages purchased separately (not via bundles)
- Displays approval status (Active/Pending)
- Quick access to start quiz

### 5. **Enhanced Profile Sidebar**
- User avatar with initials
- Profile information (name, email, user ID)
- Quick stats showing bundle and package counts
- Sticky positioning on larger screens

### 6. **Responsive Design**
- **Mobile**: Single column, stacked layout
- **Tablet**: Adjusted spacing and padding
- **Desktop**: 4-column grid (3 for content, 1 for profile sidebar)

## User Flow

## Data Flow

### API Calls Made:
1. `GET /api/users/me` - Fetch user profile
2. `GET /api/purchases/mine` - Fetch all purchases (bundles & packages)
3. `GET /api/bundles/[id]` - Fetch full bundle details for each purchased bundle (includes packages and questions)

### State Management:
```typescript
- user: User profile data
- pkgPurchases: PackagePurchase[] - Individual package purchases
- bundlePurchases: BundlePurchase[] - Bundle purchase records
- purchasedBundles: Bundle[] - Full bundle details with packages
- expandedBundles: Set<string> - Tracks which bundles are expanded
```

## Visual Features

### Color Scheme:
- **Blue/Indigo Gradients**: Bundle headers and welcome section
- **Green**: Savings indicators, active status
- **Yellow**: Pending approval status
- **Gray**: Secondary information and borders
- **White**: Content backgrounds

### Interactive Elements:

### Icons & Emojis:
- 📦 Bundles
- 📝 Questions
- ⏱️ Time limit

## Empty States
- **No Bundles**: Shows a friendly empty state with a call-to-action button
- **No Packages in Bundle**: Displays a message when a bundle is empty
