## Setup Requirements

### AWS Configuration Needed
1. Create AWS account
2. Create S3 bucket
3. Configure bucket policy for public read
4. Configure CORS
5. Create IAM user with S3 permissions
6. Get access keys
7. Add credentials to `.env.local`

### Local Development
1. Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local`
2. Fill in AWS credentials
3. Restart dev server
4. Test upload in admin panel

### Optional: LocalStack for Local Testing
- Can use LocalStack to avoid AWS costs during development
- Instructions in `docs/S3_SETUP_GUIDE.md`

## Database Migration

Run on server:
```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
```

This applies the migration:
- `20251026015136_add_optional_imageurl_to_question`

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Configure AWS S3 bucket and credentials
- [ ] Create `.env.local` with AWS credentials
- [ ] Restart development server
- [ ] Login as admin
- [ ] Navigate to course questions
- [ ] Create new question with image upload
- [ ] Verify upload progress shows
- [ ] Verify image preview appears
- [ ] Submit question
- [ ] Verify image displays in question list
- [ ] Edit question and replace image
- [ ] Verify new image uploads and displays
- [ ] Remove image from question
- [ ] Verify image is removed
- [ ] View question in practice mode as student
- [ ] Verify image displays correctly

## Future Improvements

### High Priority
- [ ] Server-side upload with pre-signed URLs (security)
- [ ] Automatic image deletion when question deleted
- [ ] Image optimization/compression

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Drag-and-drop upload UI
- [ ] Paste from clipboard
- [ ] Image library/gallery
- [ ] CDN integration (CloudFront)

### Low Priority
- [ ] Multiple images per question
- [ ] Image cropping/editing
- [ ] Automatic thumbnail generation
