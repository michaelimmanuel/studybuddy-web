## Answer Explanation Feature

### üÜï Enhanced Learning with Explanations

The question system now supports detailed explanations for each answer:

**For Admins:**
- ‚úÖ Can add explanations when creating/editing questions
- ‚úÖ Can see all explanations and correct answers
- ‚úÖ Can use explanations to improve question quality

**For Students:**
- ‚ùå Explanations are hidden during normal viewing
- ‚úÖ Can be shown explanations in practice/quiz mode (frontend choice)
- ‚úÖ Enhanced learning when explanations are revealed

### Example Usage Patterns

1. **Study Mode**: Show explanations immediately after student answers
2. **Quiz Mode**: Hide explanations until quiz completion
3. **Review Mode**: Show all explanations for learning reinforcement
4. **Admin Preview**: Always show explanations for content review
