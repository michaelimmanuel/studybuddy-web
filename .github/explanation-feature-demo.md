Understanding variables is crucial because they allow programs to store, manipulate, and retrieve data dynamically during execution.",
  "answers": [
    {
      "text": "A container for storing data values",
      "isCorrect": true
    },
    {
      "text": "A type of function",
      "isCorrect": false
    },
    {
      "text": "A programming language",
      "isCorrect": false
    }
  ]
}
```

### ðŸ”„ API Compatibility

The implementation follows a simplified approach:
- One explanation per question (0-1000 characters)

- Backward compatible with existing questions
- Cleaner data structure and easier content management

### ðŸš€ Benefits of Single Explanation Approach

3. **Cleaner UI**: Less cluttered interface with focused, meaningful explanations
4. **Easier Maintenance**: Single explanation to update instead of multiple answer-specific explanations

### ðŸŽ¯ Ready for Enhanced Learning

The explanation feature sets the foundation for advanced learning modes:

1. **Study Mode**: Show explanation after answering to reinforce learning
2. **Quiz Mode**: Hide explanations until completion, then reveal for review
3. **Review Mode**: Display all explanations for comprehensive concept understanding
4. **Admin Preview**: Always visible for content quality review

### ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

To complete the learning experience, consider implementing:

1. **User-facing explanation modes** in `PracticeQuestions.tsx`
2. **Quiz completion summary** with explanations for wrong answers
3. **Learning analytics** tracking explanation effectiveness
4. **Bulk explanation import/export** for content management
